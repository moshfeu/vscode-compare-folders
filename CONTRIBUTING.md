## üèóÔ∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict typing
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier (configured in `.prettierrc`)

  - Functions/variables: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

### Project Structure
- **Services** (`src/services/`): Business logic
- **Providers** (`src/providers/`): VS Code tree data providers
- **Models** (`src/models/`): Data structures and interfaces
- **Utils** (`src/utils/`): Helper functions
- **Constants** (`src/constants/`): Application constants

### Writing Code

#### Adding New Commands
1. Add command constant to `src/constants/commands.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const MY_NEW_COMMAND = 'foldersCompare.myNewCommand';
   ```

2. Register in `src/extension.ts`:
   ```typescript
   commands.registerCommand(MY_NEW_COMMAND, handler)
   ```

3. Add to `package.json` manifest:
   ```json
   {
     "command": "foldersCompare.myNewCommand",
     "title": "My New Command",
     "category": "CompareFolders"
   }
   ```

#### Adding New Settings
1. Add to `package.json` configuration:
   ```json
   "compareFolders.myNewSetting": {
     "type": "boolean",
     "default": false,
     "description": "Description of my setting"
   }
   ```

2. Use in code via configuration service:
   ```typescript
   import { getConfiguration } from './services/configuration';
   const { myNewSetting } = getConfiguration('myNewSetting');
   ```

### Testing Your Changes
