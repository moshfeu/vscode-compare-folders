The extension allows you to compare folders, show the diffs in a list and present diff in a splitted view side by side.

### Thanks

The extension uses the great [`dir-compare`](https://github.com/gliviu/dir-compare) package made by [Liviu Grigorescu](https://github.com/gliviu). If you like this extension, please give a star to `dir-compare`!

## Limitations

Currently seems like there might be issues [[#81](https://github.com/moshfeu/vscode-compare-folders/issues/81), [#83](https://github.com/moshfeu/vscode-compare-folders/issues/83)] with comparing local and remote folders over ssh.
Please take this under consideration.

## How to use?

There are several ways to choose folders to compare:

- Command Palette -
  - `Compare a folder against workspace` choose a folder to compare against the workspace's folder (when workspace is not empty)
  - `Choose 2 folders and compare` - opens OS folder chooser twice
- Compare Folders Panel (Click on the icon in the Activity Bar)
  - `Click to select a folder` see 1st item
  - `Click to select folders` see 2nd item
- File explorer
  - Select 2 folders, right click and click on `Compare selected folders` see 2nd item
- From history
  - `Pick from recent compares` chose one of the pairs you compared in the past.
  - (The list can be reset by `Clear recent compares`)

`Refresh` - If there are changes in the compared folders' files, click on the `refresh` button will re-compare the folders.

## Options (under vscode settings)

- `excludeFilter` - glob string
- `includeFilter` - glob string

***Example***

```json
"compareFolders.excludeFilter": [
  "**/node_modules",
  "**/.svn",
  "**/.git"
]
```
- `diffViewTitle` - One of the options: "name only", "compared path", "full path"
- `ignoreFileNameCase` - boolean - Compare files with the same name but different case
- `diffLayout` - One of the options: "local <> compared" or "compared <> local"
- `showIdentical` - boolean - Whether or not show the identical files panel
- `useDiffMerge` - boolean - Whether or not using [`Diff & Merge`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=moshfeu.diff-merge) extension as the Diff viewer. In order to use this option, you should install the extension
- `folderLeft` + `folderRight` - strings - paths of 2 folders, compare them on the extension load.
- `ignoreExtension` - Set groups of extensions so while comparing, pairs of files considered the same file if both of the files extension are in the same group. **Note:** each extension can show **only once** it this list
- `ignoreLineEnding` - boolean - ignore crlf/lf line ending differences
- `ignoreWhiteSpaces` - boolean - ignore white spaces at the beginning and ending of a line (similar to `diff -b`)
- `ignoreAllWhiteSpaces` - boolean - ignore all white space differences (similar to `diff -w`)
- `ignoreEmptyLines` - boolean - ignore differences caused by empty lines (similar to `diff -B`)
- `respectGitIgnore` - boolean - include / exclude files based on .gitignore - this option works together with `includeFilter` and `excludeFilter` options. ⚠️ The extension supports the main basic gitignore rules. For instance, it supports negation (`!`), but it doesn't support .gitignore files in subfolders. If there is an important use case that is not supported, please open an issue.
- `compareStrategy` - One of the options: "content", "size", "date"` - The strategy to use while comparing files. Comparing by `content`, `size` or `date` (last modified time). Default is `content`.

***Example***
```json
"compareFolders.ignoreExtension": [
  ["php", "cs"]
]
```

## CLI

By calling the following command from the terminal / command line, the extension will be calling on vscode load and show the differences view

```shell
COMPARE_FOLDERS=DIFF code path/to/folder1 path/to/folder2
```
